# WesternApparel
A shopping site for a fictional company "Western Apparel". This is a portfolio demo of working with ASP.NET Core, SQL, and Javascript as a Full Stack web application. It showcases clean seperation of duties between the view, domain, and data layers. All views are fully viewport adaptive, meaning they will scale down to even the smallest devices.

I still have many ideas of where to take this project, as such it is considered non-final, and for show only. Only intended for educational use.
